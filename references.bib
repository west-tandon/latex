		  individual trees in the forest and the correlation between

		  node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost
		  (Y. Freund {\&} R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings
		  of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156),
		  but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal
		  estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and
		  these are used to show the response to increasing the
		  number of features used in the splitting. Internal
		  estimates are also used to measure variable importance.
		  These ideas are also applicable to regression.",

		  invariant features from images that can be used to perform
		  reliable matching between different views of an object or
		  scene. The features are invariant to image scale and
		  rotation, and are shown to provide robust matching across a
		  substantial range of affine distortion, change in 3D
		  viewpoint, addition of noise, and change in illumination.
		  The features are highly distinctive, in the sense that a
		  single feature can be correctly matched with high
		  probability against a large database of features from many
		  images. This paper also describes an approach to using
		  these features for object recognition. The recognition
		  proceeds by matching individual features to a database of
		  features from known objects using a fast nearest-neighbor
		  algorithm, followed by a Hough transform to identify
		  clusters belonging to a single object, and finally
		  performing verification through least-squares solution for
		  consistent pose parameters. This approach to recognition
		  can robustly identify objects among clutter and occlusion
		  while achieving near real-time performance.",
